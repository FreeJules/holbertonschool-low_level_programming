## 0x1D. C - Search Algorithms

### Read:

- [Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
- [Space complexity (1)](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)
- [Space complexity (2)](http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/U1_T3.html)

### What you should learn from this project

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

### Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, ... is forbidden.
- In the following examples, the main.c files are showed as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one showed in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
* You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:
  * O(1)
  * O(n)
  * O(n!)
  * n*m -> O(nm)
  * n square -> O(n^2)
  * sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
  * log(n) -> O(log(n))
  * n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
